## Generating Client Documentation

Material for MkDocs is used for documentation. You can generate the documentation HTML
for this client locally with the following:

```bash
# Install documentation dependencies
make docs-install

# Serve documentation locally
make docs-serve

# OR build static HTML documentation
make docs

# Clean docs artifacts
make docs-clean
```
